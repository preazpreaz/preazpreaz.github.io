  <h1> Alejandro's Top Five Favorite Albums </h1>
  <h3> 5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mw6k0v80FRFWZFcNDwPY0UufIdb-hzukc" target="_blank">Some Rap Songs</a> 
    by Earl Sweatshirt </h3>

  <p> After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus <i>Some Rap Songs</i>
    is a true display of lyricism and story telling. In this album, Earl dives into vunerable themes such as
    his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle
    who had helped raised him. The production on the album is equally nothing short but phenomenal, as
    Earl combines a unique production style of sample flips from old records, remixing these elder songs
    into something that sounds fresh and new. Earl is unafraid to put on a display of vunerability
    in exchange for some of the most emotionally touching lines that reflect on Earl's state of mind
    at the time of recording the album. Don't let the bare simplicity of the cover and album title
    fool you, as paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy. </p>

  <p> An album that is sonically three decades ahead of its time, <i> In The Court Of The Crimson King</i>, released in 1969, is undoubtedly
  one of the most influential musical projects of all time. Combining different sonic elements of rock and jazz, the album would set the stage
  for the rise of progressive rock in the late 1960's. Apart from being a sonic masterpiece split across a series of just five tracks, 
  the album's lyrics divulge into relevant topics of its time period. The album is a critique of the Vietnam War, with in-depth lines such
  as "The yellow jester does not play, but gently pulls the strings/ And smiles as the puppets dance in the court of the crimson king"
  symbolizing the consequences of war and corrupt politicians. </p>

  <h3> 3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU9Fe-WXew4&list=PL8YH4mOwWryVT43-RHR4-FNTytJfTHfEr" target="_blank"> 
  Yeezus </a> by Kanye West </h3>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Yeezus_album_cover.png">
  <p> Released in 2013, Kanye West's <i>Yeezus</i> has proven to be one of the most nonconformist and rebellious albums of all time, displaying
  West's true identity as a contrarian. The albums heavy industrial and experimental sound is a complete 180 from West's previous album <i>
    My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, showcasing West trading in his soothing soul and accessible production made for West to escape
  the turmoil of controversy from past events as well as tragedies for the albums unorthodox and raw sound combined with West's egotistical
    nature at full display (hence the title, <i>Yeezus</i>). The beauty of <i>Yeezus</i> is despite it's self-centered and aggressive nature,
  West sheds his mask to display vunerability. The albums influence, although it being a fairly young album, has already seen shape into the
  works of different artists like Travis Scott's 2023 <i>UTOPIA</i>, who have adopted the raw sound and nature of <i>Yeezus</i>. </p>

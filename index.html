        <p>After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus <i>Some Rap Songs</i> is a true display of lyricism and storytelling. In this album, Earl dives into vulnerable themes such as his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle who had helped raise him. The production on the album is equally nothing short but phenomenal, as Earl combines a unique production style of sample flips from old records, remixing these elder songs into something that sounds fresh and new. Earl is unafraid to put on a display of vulnerability in exchange for some of the most emotionally touching lines that reflect on Earl's state of mind at the time of recording the album. My personal favorite from the album is "Azucar", where Earl showcases his affinity in lyricism whilst pouring on one of the grimiest and rawest flows that I have heard. The production of the song is special in itself, with a soulful sample chop that is looped perfectly. Don't let the bare simplicity of the cover and album title fool you, as paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy.</p>

        <p>An album that is sonically three decades ahead of its time, <i>In The Court Of The Crimson King</i>, released in 1969, is undoubtedly one of the most influential musical projects of all time. Combining different sonic elements of rock and jazz, the album would set the stage for the rise of progressive rock in the late 1960s. Apart from being a sonic masterpiece split across a series of just five tracks, the album's lyrics delve into relevant topics of its time period. The album is a critique of the Vietnam War, with in-depth lines such as "The yellow jester does not play, but gently pulls the strings/ And smiles as the puppets dance in the court of the crimson king" symbolizing the consequences of war and corrupt politicians.</p>

        <h3>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU9Fe-WXew4&list=PL8YH4mOwWryVT43-RHR4-FNTytJfTHfEr" target="_blank">Yeezus</a> by Kanye West</h3>

        <p>Released in 2013, Kanye West's <i>Yeezus</i> has proven to be one of the most nonconformist and rebellious albums of all time, displaying West's true identity as a contrarian. The album's heavy industrial and experimental sound is a complete 180 from West's previous album <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, showcasing West trading in his soothing soul and accessible production made for West to escape the turmoil of controversy from past events as well as tragedies for the album's unorthodox and raw sound combined with West's egotistical nature at full display (hence the title, <i>Yeezus</i>). This radical sound helps assist the theme of Kanye West being nonconforming; Kanye expresses his thirst for success in the fashion industry despite criticism (which would eventually evolve to West's $8 billion dollar fashion line with Adidas) to his struggles in the music industry. The beauty of <i>Yeezus</i> is despite its self-centered and aggressive nature, West sheds his mask to display vulnerability in tracks like "Guilt Trip" and "Blood on the Leaves". In the mid-way point of the opening track, "On Sight", West includes a soul sample that states "He'll give us what we need/ it may not be what we want", being prophetic to how West's album would become a cultural reset in the genre of Hip-Hop. The album's influence, although it being a fairly young album, has already seen shape into the works of different artists like Travis Scott's 2023 <i>UTOPIA</i>, who have adopted the raw sound and nature of <i>Yeezus</i>.</p>

        <h3>2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nO7IA1DeeI&list=PL9dk_xtWpAkKXxzv_TfLWmlJj6G3quWQ2" target="_blank">Donuts</a> by J Dilla</h3>

        <p>J Dilla was one of the most prominent producers in the early 2000s, having worked with different artists like Common, MF Doom, and Kanye West. His life would forever change in late 2005 when he would be diagnosed with a terminal blood disease which had no cure. As he felt his health rapidly deteriorating, J Dilla would rush to complete his final album <i>Donuts</i> whilst on his death bed in the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. On his death bed, J Dilla would produce and sample beats using nothing more than an MPC 3000 (when compared to modern beat makers, the MPC 3000 has no visuals meaning every individual beat was crafted with just hearing) and a record player with records chosen from his loved ones. The standout track from the album is evidently "Don't Cry", a productional masterpiece made by J Dilla a week from his death as a message for his mother, wife, and children, reminding them to not cry when he would be gone. The song is undoubtedly a sonic treasure; J Dilla would pioneer the use of "swing time", a production technique where beats are not synchronized in a proper time signature. <i>Donuts</i> would be released on February 9, 2006, three days after J Dilla's birthday with J Dilla passing away on February 10, 2006, just one day after the album was released. James Dewitt Yancey was just 32 at his time of passing, with his MPC 3000 now on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of African Americans.</p>

        <p>If I could recommend just one album for anyone to listen to, it would be <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i>. An instant classic, not just in Hip-Hop, but across all genres of music, <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> is a cultural landmark set by a young Kendrick Lamar. When compared to Lamar's previous first project, <i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d City</i>, Kendrick Lamar trades in modern Hip-Hop beats for a traditional funk and jazz sound, with nearly every song being composed of live instrumentals included with live bass. Each track on the album provides a message that delivers raw emotions and feelings that cannot be easily described in words. The album delivers Kendrick Lamar's story, from being born and raised in Compton and the struggle with the societal issues that he faced growing up to being celebrated as one of Hip-Hop's most prominent artists. The album's standout track, "Alright" has become an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement, proving Kendrick Lamar to be not only an artist but a voice for a generation of people who have felt oppression. <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> explores themes of race, depression, and self-acceptance, combining social awareness with intricate storytelling that speaks to audiences across generations. The album's impact can still be felt today, as Kendrick Lamar's artistry has paved the way for many up-and-coming artists who want to use their voice for social change. The album is a journey, one that connects the listener to Kendrick's world and allows them to experience the pain and joy that comes with it. It is a masterpiece that transcends time and resonates with anyone willing to listen.</p>

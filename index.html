    <p> After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus <i>Some Rap Songs</i>
      is a true display of lyricism and storytelling. In this album, Earl dives into vulnerable themes such as
      his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle
      who had helped raised him. The production on the album is equally nothing short but phenomenal, as
      Earl combines a unique production style of sample flips from old records, remixing these elder songs
      into something that sounds fresh and new. Earl is unafraid to put on a display of vulnerability
      in exchange for some of the most emotionally touching lines that reflect on Earl's state of mind
      at the time of recording the album. My personal favorite from the album is "Azucar", where Earl showcases
      his affinity in lyricism whilst pouring on one of the grimiest and rawest flows that I have heard. The production
      of the song is special in itself, with a soulful sample chop that is looped perfectly. Don't let the bare simplicity of the 
      cover and album title fool you, as paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy. </p>

    <p> An album that is sonically three decades ahead of its time, <i> In The Court Of The Crimson King</i>, released in 1969, is undoubtedly
    one of the most influential musical projects of all time. Combining different sonic elements of rock and jazz, the album would set the stage
    for the rise of progressive rock in the late 1960's. Apart from being a sonic masterpiece split across a series of just five tracks, 
    the album's lyrics divulge into relevant topics of its time period. The album is a critique of the Vietnam War, with in-depth lines such
    as "The yellow jester does not play, but gently pulls the strings/ And smiles as the puppets dance in the court of the crimson king"
    symbolizing the consequences of war and corrupt politicians. </p>

    Yeezus </a> by Kanye West </h3>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Yeezus_album_cover.png">
    <p> Released in 2013, Kanye West's <i>Yeezus</i> has proven to be one of the most nonconformist and rebellious albums of all time, displaying
    West's true identity as a contrarian. The album's heavy industrial and experimental sound is a complete 180 from West's previous album <i>
      My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, showcasing West trading in his soothing soul and accessible production made for West to escape
    the turmoil of controversy from past events as well as tragedies for the album's unorthodox and raw sound combined with West's egotistical
      nature at full display (hence the title, <i>Yeezus</i>). This radical sound helps assist the theme of Kanye West being nonconforming;
      Kanye expresses his thirst for success in the fashion industry despite criticism (which would eventually evolve to West's $8 billion dollar fashion line
      with Adidas) to his struggles in the music industry. The beauty of <i>Yeezus</i> is despite its self-centered and aggressive nature,
    West sheds his mask to display vulnerability in tracks like "Guilt Trip" and "Blood on the Leaves". In the mid-way point of the opening track, "On Sight", 
      West includes a soul sample that states "He'll give us what we need/ it may not be what we want", being prophetic to how West's album would become a 
      cultural reset in the genre of Hip-Hop. The album's influence, although it being a fairly young album, has already seen shape into the
    works of different artists like Travis Scott's 2023 <i>UTOPIA</i>, who have adopted the raw sound and nature of <i>Yeezus</i>. </p>

    <h3> 2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nO7IA1DeeI&list=PL9dk_xtWpAkKXxzv_TfLWmlJj6G3quWQ2" target="_blank"> Donuts </a> 
    by J Dilla </h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/Dilladonutscover.jpg/220px-Dilladonutscover.jpg">
    <p> J Dilla was one of the most prominent producers in the early 2000's, having worked with different artists like Common, MF Doom,
    and Kanye West. His life would forever change in late 2005 when he would be diagnosed with a terminal blood disease which had no cure.
    As he felt his health rapidly deteriorating, J Dilla would rush to complete his final album <i>Donuts</i> whilst on his death bed in the
    Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. On his death bed, J Dilla would produce and sample beats using nothing more than an MPC 3000 (when
    compared to modern beat makers, the MPC 3000 has no visuals meaning every individual beat was crafted with just hearing) and
    a record player with records chosen from his loved ones. The standout track from the album is evidently "Don't Cry", a productional 
    masterpiece made by J Dilla a week from his death as a message for his mother, wife, and children, reminding them to not cry when 
    he would be gone. The song is undoubtedly a sonic treasure; J Dilla would pioneer the use of "swing time", a production technique
    where beats are not synchronized in a proper time signature. <i>Donuts</i> would be released on February 9, 2006, three days after J Dilla's birthday
    with J Dilla passing away on February 10, 2006, just one day after the album was released. James Dewitt Yancey was just 32 at his time of
    passing, with his MPC 3000 now on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of African Americans. </p>

    by Kendrick Lamar </h3>

      target="_blank">
    <p> If I could recommend just one album for anyone to listen to, it would be <i> To Pimp A Butterfly</i>. An instant classic, not just in Hip-Hop, 
      but across all genres of music, <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> is a cultural landmark set by
      a young Kendrick Lamar. When compared to Lamar's previous first project, <i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d City</i>, Kendrick Lamar trades in
      modern Hip-Hop beats for a traditional funk and jazz sound, with nearly every song being composed of live instrumentals included with
      live bass. The genius of the album resides in the storytelling, where Kendrick portrays himself as a fictional character similar to 
      his Compton upbringing who faces an internal struggle with his own conscious and temptations that present themselves to him after 
      signing to a record label, moving out of Compton, and becoming a superstar. Kendrick would go on to touch on sensitive themes
      that are still relevant today such as institutional racism and prejudice, while at the same time Lamar promotes cultural pride
      in being Black. </p>

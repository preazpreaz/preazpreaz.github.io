  <h1> Alejandro's Top Five Favorite Albums </h1>
  <h3> 10. Some Rap Songs by Earl Sweatshirt </h3>

  <p> After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus Some Rap Songs 
    is a true display of lyricism and story telling. In this album, Earl dives into vunerable themes such as
    his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle
    who had helped raised him. Paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the 
    border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy.

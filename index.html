  <h1> Alejandro's Top Five Favorite Albums </h1>
  <h3> 5. <i>Some Rap Songs</i> by Earl Sweatshirt </h3>

  <p> After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus Some Rap Songs 
    is a true display of lyricism and story telling. In this album, Earl dives into vunerable themes such as
    his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle
    who had helped raised him. Paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the 
    border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy. </p>

   <h3> 4. <i>In The Court Of The Crimson King</i> by King Crimson </h3>

  <p> An album that is sonically three decades ahead of its time, <i> In The Court Of The Crimson King</i>, released in 1969, is undoubtedly
  one of the most influential musical projects of all time. Combining different sonic elements of rock and jazz, the album would set the stage
  for the rise of progressive rock in the late 1960's. Apart from being a sonical masterpiece split across a series of just five tracks, 
  the album's lyrics dulge into relevant topics of it's time period. The album is a critque of the Vietnam War, with in-depth lines such
  as "The yellow jester does not play, but gentley pulls the strings/ And smiles as the puppets dance in the court of the crimson king"
  symbolizng the consequences of war and corrupt politicans. </p>

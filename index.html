  <h3> 5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mw6k0v80FRFWZFcNDwPY0UufIdb-hzukc" target="_blank">Some Rap Songs</a> 
    by Earl Sweatshirt </h3>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Some_Rap_Songs.jpg/220px-Some_Rap_Songs.jpg">
  <p> After a long awaited 3 years since his last project, Earl Sweatshirt's 2018 magnum opus <i>Some Rap Songs</i>
    is a true display of lyricism and story telling. In this album, Earl dives into vunerable themes such as
    his struggle with mental health following several losses in his life, including his father and uncle
    who had helped raised him. The production on the album is equally nothing short but phenomenal, as
    Earl combines a unique production style of sample flips from old records, remixing these elder songs
    into something that sounds fresh and new. Earl is unafraid to put on a display of vunerability
    in exchange for some of the most emotionally touching lines that reflect on Earl's state of mind
    at the time of recording the album. Don't let the bare simplicity of the cover and album title
    fool you, as paired with avant-garde jazz, this album is a perfect blend that makes the border between dreams and Hip-Hop dizzy. </p>

  <p> An album that is sonically three decades ahead of its time, <i> In The Court Of The Crimson King</i>, released in 1969, is undoubtedly
  one of the most influential musical projects of all time. Combining different sonic elements of rock and jazz, the album would set the stage
  for the rise of progressive rock in the late 1960's. Apart from being a sonic masterpiece split across a series of just five tracks, 
  the album's lyrics divulge into relevant topics of its time period. The album is a critique of the Vietnam War, with in-depth lines such
  as "The yellow jester does not play, but gently pulls the strings/ And smiles as the puppets dance in the court of the crimson king"
  symbolizing the consequences of war and corrupt politicians. </p>

  Yeezus </a> by Kanye West </h3>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Yeezus_album_cover.png">
  <p> Released in 2013, Kanye West's <i>Yeezus</i> has proven to be one of the most nonconformist and rebellious albums of all time, displaying
  West's true identity as a contrarian. The albums heavy industrial and experimental sound is a complete 180 from West's previous album <i>
    My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, showcasing West trading in his soothing soul and accessible production made for West to escape
  the turmoil of controversy from past events as well as tragedies for the albums unorthodox and raw sound combined with West's egotistical
    nature at full display (hence the title, <i>Yeezus</i>). This radical sound helps assist the theme of Kanye West being nonconforming;
    Kanye expresses his thirst for success in the fashion industry despite criticsm (which would eventually evolve to West's $8 billion dollar fashion line
    with Adidas) to his struggles in the music industry. The beauty of <i>Yeezus</i> is despite it's self-centered and aggressive nature,
  West sheds his mask to display vunerability in tracks like "Guilt Trip" and "Blood on the Leaves". In the mid-way point of the opening track, "On Sight", 
    West includes a soul sample that states "He'll give us what we need/ it may not be what we want", being prophetic to how West's album would become a 
    cultural reset in the genre of Hip-Hop. The albums influence, although it being a fairly young album, has already seen shape into the
  works of different artists like Travis Scott's 2023 <i>UTOPIA</i>, who have adopted the raw sound and nature of <i>Yeezus</i>. </p>

  <h3> 2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nO7IA1DeeI&list=PL9dk_xtWpAkKXxzv_TfLWmlJj6G3quWQ2" target="_blank"> Donuts </a> 
  by J Dilla </h3>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/Dilladonutscover.jpg/220px-Dilladonutscover.jpg">
  <p> J Dilla was one of the most prominent producers in the early 2000's, having worked with different artists like Common, MF Doom,
  and Kanye West. His life would forever change in late 2005 when he would be diagnosed with a terminal blood disease which had no cure.
  As he felt his health rapidly deteriorating, J Dilla would rush to complete his final album <i>Donuts</i> whilst on his death bed in the
  Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. On his death bed, J Dilla would produce and sample beats using nothing more than an MPC 3000 (when
  compared to modern beat makers, the MPC 3000 has no visuals meaning every individual beat was crafted with just hearing) and
  a record player with records chosen from his loved ones. The standout track from the album is evidently "Don't Cry", a productional 
  masterpiece made by J Dilla a week from his death as a message for his mother, wife, and children, reminding them to not cry when 
  he would be gone. The song is undoubtedly a sonic treasure; J Dilla would pioneer the use of "swing time", a production technique
  where beats are not synchronized in a proper time signature. <i>Donuts</i> would be released on February 9, 2006, three days after J Dilla's birthday
  with J Dilla passing away on February 10, 2006, just one day after the album was released. James Dewitt Yancey was just 32 at his time of
  passing, with his MPC 3000 now on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of African Americans. </p>

  <h3> 1. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n_dmtzA0IWImBN3fbUBUl_WgD-YSaMZaI" target="_blank"> To Pimp A Butterfly </a>
  by Kendrick Lamar </h3>
  <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426099817173/f1efb3f4-9a6d-4f78-8ca8-594ab646d198-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none"

  <p> If I could recommend just one album for anyone to listen to, it would be <i> To Pimp A Butterfly</i>. An instant classic, not just in Hip-Hop, 
    but across all genres of music, <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> is a cultural landmark set by
    a young Kendrick Lamar. When compared to Lamar's previous first project, <i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d City</i>, Kendrick Lamar trades in
    modern Hip-Hop beats for a traditional funk and jazz sound, with nearly every song being composed of live instrumentals included with
    live bass. The genius of the album lies in the content of it's lyrics; the album is a complete narrative story where Lamar displays
    a masterclass in storytelling that tackles different topics such as the complexity of race in the United States, self-discovery,
    racial inequality, and a critique of materialism. The album starts off with "Wesley's Theory", a play on words from the African-American
    actor Wesley Snipes who was arrested for tax evasion as the narrative of the album begins with Lamar falling for the temptations of
    materalism and goods after his initial success after the release of his first album <i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d City</i>. The narrative continues
    off to "King Kunta", another play on the name of Kunta Kinte, a slave who is a fictional character from the highly critically acclaimed
    novel <i>Roots</i>, where Lamar is deep into the rabbit hole of American materalism of music record labels with Lamar feeling at
    the peak of his status and fame. The album further goes off to "Institutionalized" and "These Walls", where Lamar uses his status and riches for negativity. The album
    then leads to "u", a heartbreaking 4-minute compliation of Lamar fulled of regret and guilt as he recognizes the damage he caused through
    the abuse and temptation of status and fame, then proceeding to "Alright", where Lamar conveys that despite all his struggles, everything
    would turn out okay. The narrative of the album shifts into Lamar delving into his roots as an African-American as well as an individual
    in general, showing a true skill in lyricism and story telling that is present in songs like "How Much a Dollar Cost" and "i", a cheerful song enriched
    with themes of self-love which is the complete opposite of what occured in "u". The album ends with 
    "Mortal Man", a 12-minute lyrical masterpiece that ends with Lamar speaking to an artifical version of the late Tupac Shakur, showing a full
    circle moment in the albums narrative. <i> To Pimp A Butterfly </i>'s significance was instant; tracks like "Alright" would become
    anthems of protes, the album winning "Best Rap Album" at the 2016 GRAMMY awards, and the album being archived in Harvard University's library.
